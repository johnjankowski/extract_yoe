[December, 2015] [July, 2011]

Hardware Implementation of Blowfish Algorithm

[November 2015]

 64 bits real time data (temperature of Nexys 4 board) encryption with 256 bits keys at a rate of 100

MHz and power consumption of 1.99 Watt. Verification of Algorithm using code coverage and assertion

 Technologies: Verilog, System verilog, python, Xilinx Vivado, Xilinx ISE, Synopsys VCS and Design vision

Bus Arbitrator Design

[April 2015]

 Developed an arbitrator scheme similar to AHB for multiple masters and slaves that runs at100 Mhz

 Used constrained random testing and code coverage to test the functional and power verification.

 Technologies: System Verilog, python, Synopsys Design vision, NC Verilog, Synopsys VCS.

MIPS processor

[April 2015]

 Lead a team of 3 to design a MIPS32 5-stage pipelined processor (with hazard detection and data

forwarding), with 4KB 2-way associative instruction cache, write-through, no-write allocate data cache

Feature point extraction of an image

[November 2014]

 Developed an algorithm in Matlab in a team of 2, to calculate the corner points of an image and then

implemented it in verilog using Quartus II and used FPGA to display the output on a monitor.

Synchronous Interface with BIST

[May 2014]

 Developed a Serial to Parallel FIFO using two way flag model and Synthesized at 100 MHz frequency.

Performed Floor Planning, Place & Route, and Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS) using Cadence Encounter

Spread Spectrum Search Engine

[November 2014]

 Designed to find the frequency and phase of a direct sequence PSK spread spectrum (SS) signal mixed

with several other SS signals below the noise floor. The design block will correlate the ADC samples

to a pseudo random number (PRN) generator.

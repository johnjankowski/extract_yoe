Professional Experience

Uber Technologies, Austin, TX Operations & Logistics Manager

January 2017 - Present

I work on a City Operations team at Uber and focus primarily on Driver Acquisition and Driver Engagement to ensure our drivers-partners are in a position to succeed and meet the ever-growing rider demand in our markets.

I conduct ad hoc analyses with R and SQL to better understand trends in our business. I balance this analytical rigor with strong operational excellence, and I'm always looking to improve and streamline processes.

Example projects include: Running driver incentives to balance supply and demand in Uber's dynamic marketplace, formulating competitive strategy for Uber's re-launch in Austin following a one-year absence, and using a machine learning model to track Twitter sentiment leading up to our re-entry into Austin

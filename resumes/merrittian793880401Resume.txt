Dear Sir or Madam,
My name is Ian Merritt. I'm grateful for the opportunity to apply to the analyst team at Taco Bell. After reviewing your job description for Analyst, Strategic Development & Analysis, it's clear that you're looking for a versatile candidate to handle the numerous and varied responsibilities associated with this role. Given these requirements, I am certain that I can meet and exceed all expectations.
I am a graduate of Case Western Reserve University's School of Law, and I also have previous undergraduate experience business information management and computer engineering. While I plan to take the bar exam within the next few years just to prove that I can, my interests and career goals are directed towards the business world and not the direct practice of law. Specifically, my educational path to the business world gives me a different viewpoint and complementary skills, such as research and analysis with a focus on complex legal technicalities, that the standard path of those with just an MBA don't possess. I also gained career experience in the gaming world at EA's Tiburon studio, as well as working my way up through the food and beverage industry, experiencing every standard position from busser through front of house manager.
I believe that the analyst team is a perfect job for me, especially in the food service industry, as I have a great deal of experience in many types of restaurants. This experience, together with my more recent business and legal degrees, give me the skills needed to analyze and solve problems with complex variables. I will also be able to use my legal skills outside of a pure legal environment, and bridge the gap between the legal and business world that will allow me to pursue the career I wish to follow.
Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Ian Merritt

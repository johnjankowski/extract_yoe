Work Experience
Toastmasters International, Rancho Santa Margarita, CA
June 2014 - Present
Analyst
 Translated the board of directors vision for growth in global markets into a dynamic financial and
operational model in Excel. Wrote and presented a formal business plan to the executive team to target
Brazil, which since has established over 20 clubs and recruited over 500 new members without the
resources of physical assets or paid staff in the market. Now exploring the use of R as a more efficient
and reliable means of modeling growth.
 Served as subject matter expert on a board committee to evaluate Toastmasters' global growth strategy.
Led a multi-departmental study to test 24 committee recommendations for financial and operational
feasibility. The study involved the finance, legal, marketing, executive and IT teams, and was completed
in just four months.
 Set and managed the annual budget for each country targeted by the global growth initiative, including
accountability to monthly variance.
 Provided quantitative analysis of membership to support executive decision-making. Analyzed over 40
years of club growth to identify possible geographical or cyclical trends.
 Designed surveys and online discussion groups with Qualtrics and Qualboard to better understand the
motivations, experiences and satisfaction among Toastmasters membership.
Plante Moran Living Forward, Columbus, OH
Oct 2012 � June 2014
Analyst (Financial Consultant)
Clients of the Living Forward group are senior living providers (nursing homes, assisted living and independent
living) that are planning or undergoing new facility development, renovations or other large capital projects.
Prepared the following deliverables:
 Financial compilations for clients with small projects that did not require a large amount of funding.
 Debt capacity analyses, strategic assessment and planning for clients in the very early stages of a new
project. These often required working with the healthcare reimbursement team to obtain client-specific
Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates.
 Financial feasibility studies for large capital projects (e.g., $40 million independent living tower in
Spokane, WA). These reports were required assurance and were typically included in bond offerings. I
built an Excel template so efficient that it cut feasibility study costs in half ($8,000 per study).
 Industry conference presentations, including an impact report for county-operated facilities in Michigan.
The state was beginning to realize significant unfunded pension liabilities that would make it near
impossible for county facilities to secure funding. The presentation demonstrated how our group could
problem solve with any facilities that needed funding for renovation or expansion.

 Helped clients to better understand and manage their business by building working excel models and then
training them to use the models in their daily operations. In one case I spent two weeks shadowing key
plant supervisors to understand and analyze operations, assess the relationship between plant operations
and finance systems, and presented my findings back to my leadership team to facilitate a plan of action.
 Evaluated market potential for proposed mergers and acquisitions.

Recruiting Manager Yum! Brands/Taco Bell
Dear Recruiting Manager:
I am applying for the Analyst, Strategic Development and Analysis (Job Code: 89579BR) position posted on the LinkUp and Yum! Brands websites.
Instituting a corporate culture of teamwork and collaboration is important so ideas and best practices are shared which allow Taco Bell to keep its "Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in the World" ranking according to Fast Company. I hope to be a part of a Taco Bell team committed to collaboratively applying frameworks which help aggressively add 2,000 stores over the next decade.
I am a business educator, leadership development instructor, and organizational effectiveness specialist with a vision for transforming individuals (and firms) into high performing dynamos. My career development opportunities across the academic, nonprofit, and corporate sectors have given me the ability to: develop training programs to effectively increase individual contributions to organizations; apply different frameworks which identify organizational needs and continuous improvement solutions; coach individuals to become immediate impact workers for organizations; performance manage individuals and programs in a variety of volunteer and professional situations; engage and build influential relationships amongst various stakeholder groups in many organizations; as well as analyze data (via OLS regression in SPSS) and present summarized findings detailing leadership behavior effects on worker behaviors as part of my PhD dissertation.
Analysts are essential for partnering with colleagues to deliver solutions which help achieve organizational goals and secure a return on investment for the firm. I believe that my communication skills, strategic mindset, financial acumen, and data analysis capabilities make me a good fit for this position. I feel that I can significantly contribute to Taco Bells's overall vision of providing quality food at an exceptional price, providing excellent customer service, and getting customers to "Live Mas." My MBA (Strategic Management) and PhD (Leadership) allow me to see the connections among strategy, operational activities, human capital requirements, and financial endpoints which can make this vision a reality.
I'm excited about the opportunity to grow personally and professionally at Taco Bell in a culture of energy, opportunity, and fun. My approach to solving problems is based on collaboration and developing insight. I like to bring out the best ideas in others, so that optimal solutions and methods can be applied to solving any problem. Let's build the world's most loved, trusted and fastest growing restaurant brands together!
Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need any additional information. I look forward to being on your interview schedule. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Dear Sir or Madam,
My name is Ian Merritt. I'm grateful for the opportunity to apply to the analyst team at Taco Bell. After reviewing your job description for Analyst, Strategic Development & Analysis, it's clear that you're looking for a versatile candidate to handle the numerous and varied responsibilities associated with this role. Given these requirements, I am certain that I can meet and exceed all expectations.
I am a graduate of Case Western Reserve University's School of Law, and I also have previous undergraduate experience business information management and computer engineering. While I plan to take the bar exam within the next few years just to prove that I can, my interests and career goals are directed towards the business world and not the direct practice of law. Specifically, my educational path to the business world gives me a different viewpoint and complementary skills, such as research and analysis with a focus on complex legal technicalities, that the standard path of those with just an MBA don't possess. I also gained career experience in the gaming world at EA's Tiburon studio, as well as working my way up through the food and beverage industry, experiencing every standard position from busser through front of house manager.
I believe that the analyst team is a perfect job for me, especially in the food service industry, as I have a great deal of experience in many types of restaurants. This experience, together with my more recent business and legal degrees, give me the skills needed to analyze and solve problems with complex variables. I will also be able to use my legal skills outside of a pure legal environment, and bridge the gap between the legal and business world that will allow me to pursue the career I wish to follow.
Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
Ian Merritt

Besides excelling in a team oriented environment, I am also able to work independently using my strong analytical, problem solving and mathematical skills. Moreover, I am a fast learner and welcome any opportunity to learn new business or financial systems.
My persona matches your organization's requirements as an assertive, self-directed candidate driven by details and deadlines. I'd love a chance to work for a company that produces great products, with the skills that come naturally to me. I am certain I would add value to the team with my outgoing personality, strong analytical skills, and could use my extensive knowledge of investment decision making to further assist this company's growth.

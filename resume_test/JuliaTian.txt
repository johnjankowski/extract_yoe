Business Analyst, US Card (in Analyst Development Program)

 Led two internal consulting projects in U.S. card strategy: streamlining collections call center

operations and mitigating credit risk within our collections portfolio.

 Used Bayesian approach to model and analyze call center arrival data by using a Poisson distribution:

covariate and time effects on call volume intensity are taken into account thus allowing assessment of

different advertising strategies along with predicting arrival patterns leading to more optimized staffing

and marketing strategies

 Developed suite of new products to target collections customers in a risk based strategy using

predictive analytics to model customer behavior. Segmented customers based on risk profile and then

customized strategies for each group. Used statistical tools namely the creation of scorecards to

forecast new account behavior leading to the generation of a simple risk matrix. The matrix was then

overlaid with an individualized debt management strategy. Each strategy was monitored to facilitate

fast and regular strategy changes leading to product generation.

 Heavily involved in predictive analysis in using data, statistical algorithms and machine learning

techniques to identify the likelihood of future customer behavior based on historical data resulting in key strategy changes across the customer's lifecycle from acquisition to collections and across

departments from fraud detection and security to marketing, operations and credit risk to cultivate

competitive advantage during turbulent economic conditions and the need for competitive product

differentiation.

 Coordinated the statistical, data analytic, IT and operations teams to implement key strategies across

entire collections portfolio and progress was reported periodically to President of U.S. Card as project

analysis of customer behavior to capitalize on a confluence of forces starting with the rise of private hospitals and clinics as a key pillar in Beijing's evolving efforts to provide healthcare to 1.3 billion Chinese thus shaping China into the fastest growing asset in CIGNA's international portfolio where revenues have tripled from $100 million in 2009 to $331 million in 2012 with a million policies sold as CIGNA enjoys a wide moat in the depth of its market penetration in China with the JV company being named China's Best
